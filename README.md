# Telco Churn Prediction

This is a Data Science project that use machine learning and data tools to add value to the original data. It was written in jupyter notebooks.

# Content

### Data analysis Notebook:

It's focus on understanding data and making some analysis. Includes:
* Data Acquisition
* Data wrangling
* EDA
* Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis
* Some conclusions


### Prediction algorithms Notebook:

This is the second part, where I apply different classification algorithms to predict the categorical target that is if the client abandoned the service or not (Churn). Includes:
* Decision tree algorithm
* Random Forest algorithm
* K Near Neighbors algorithm (KNN) and optimus K
* Logistic Regression algorithm
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
