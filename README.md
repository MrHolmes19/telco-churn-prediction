# Telco Churn Prediction (Data science project)

This is a Data Science project that uses machine learning and data tools to add value to the original data. It was written in jupyter notebooks.

# Content

### Data analysis Notebook (EDA):

It's focus on understanding data and making some analysis. Includes:
* Data Acquisition
* Data wrangling
* EDA
* Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis
* Some conclusions

### Prediction algorithms Notebook (supervised learning):

This is the second part, where I apply different classification algorithms to predict the categorical target that is if the client abandoned the service or not (Churn). Includes:
* Decision tree algorithm
* K Near Neighbors algorithm (KNN) and optimus K
* Logistic Regression algorithm
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Bagging and boosting algorithms (Random Forest, XG Boosting, etc)
* Optimization processes by adjusting hyperparameters
* Cross validation
* Metrics and evaluation

### grouping algorithms notebook (non-supervised learning):

I used some clasiffication algorithms to segment the Data as:
* K-means clustering
* Agglomerative clustering
* Silhoutte method for validation

### dataset

.CSV File extracted from Kaggle

### requirements.txt

To make the virtual env. It runs in Anaconda Jupyter notebook
